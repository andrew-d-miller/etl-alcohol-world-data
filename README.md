ETL Group Project - Alcohol Consumption Data

## Finding Data
Using 3 sources of data from Kaggle
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marcospessotto/happiness-and-alcohol-consumption)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sansuthi/alcohol-consumption)

## Data Cleanup & Analysis

Perform ETL on the data. Plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that you will extract from.

* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).

* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).

* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

Submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.

## Project Report

Submit a Final Report that describes the following:

* **E**xtract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).

* **T**ransform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.

* **L**oad: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
