ETL Group Project - Alcohol Consumption and Life Expectancy by Country

Andrew Miller, Taylor Sperry, Will Jung, Abdellah Hady, Emmanuel Obodoechine

## Finding Data
Using 3 sources of data from Kaggle
* [Kaggle - Life Expectancy](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
* [Kaggle - Happiness Score](https://www.kaggle.com/marcospessotto/happiness-and-alcohol-consumption)
* [Kaggle - Suicide Rates](https://www.kaggle.com/sansuthi/alcohol-consumption)

## Data Cleanup & Analysis

Perform ETL on the data. Plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that we extracted from were CSV files

* The type of transformation needed for this data was to clean the data by dropping/renaming columns, sort by year (2015), and merge the dataframes on the country

* The final production database is relational 

* There's one final table after the merge that will be used in the production database

## Project Report

* **E**xtract: your original data sources were CSV files that we downloaded from Kaggle

* **T**ransform: clean, sort, merge

* **L**oad: the final database into postgres
